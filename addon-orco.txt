This file is added just for convenience to pick it in file selection
dialog during loading of temporary extension in Thunderbird.
It is selected by default and creates a descriptive entry
in the list of recent documents.
This file allows to avoid choosing some directory by default.
Actually Thunderbird needs a directory (with manifest.json file)
but it asks for a file.
