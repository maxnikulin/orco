#+begin_abstract
orco is an extension for the
[[https://www.thunderbird.net/][Thunderbird]] mail and news client
that is a bridge to notes stored
in [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]]
for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
It adds a column to message list view displaying
an icon for messages when their Message-ID's are mentioned
in Org files (actually any text files with the same link format).
#+end_abstract

* It is an alpha version

Compatibility: Thunderbird-91 and above.

*Warning.* Project development stage: proof of concept.
I am not tightly familiar with Thunderbird internals.
I hope, it should not break anything in your precious profile
data, but I am not completely sure.

*Warning.* This add-on does not store any data in =.msf= files
(Thunderbird stores the custom column properties though).
Lack of such optimization may impair performance,
however I have not faced such issue yet.
The extension does not add or modify message headers
to reflect presence in your notes. Depending on your workflow
it may be an advantage or in some cases perhaps a defect.

* Introduction

To see how it works you should have some references to messages
in your notes.
The idea is to use links based on Message-ID header, primary
=mid:= ones, for background see
[[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2392.html][RFC 2392 - Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators]].
Other link types like =news:= or mail list archive sites
may require some configuration.  Examples of such links:
=mid:sn60sv$105n$1@ciao.gmane.io=
=[[news://news.gmane.io/gmane.emacs.orgmode/sn60sv$105n$1@ciao.gmane.io][LinkRemark browser extension]]=
=<https://list.orgmode.org/sn60sv$105n$1@ciao.gmane.io/>=.
To access local files Thunderbird extensions should use so called
native messaging helper application (backend).
The recommended tool to extract links from the notes is
bURL <https://github.com/maxnikulin/burl>.
You may create your own one, but I do not consider API as settled,
so tracking of changes may be a burden.
Configure the helper and specify its ID (name) in the add-on configuration.

Creating notes linked to messages is a subject of another add-on,
so this extension does not use
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html][org-protocol]]
([[info:org#Protocols][info "(org) Protocols"]]).

* Install

I am going to publish orco add-on to the Thunderbird extension catalog later.
For a while download the latest release as an =.xpi= file
from the releases section of the GitHub project
<https://github.com/maxnikulin/orco/releases/>
and use "install from file" option in the add-on management tab.
Alternatively a repository clone may be loaded as a temporary extension
from the add-on debugging tab. Thunderbird removes column state from
folder views when temporary add-on is not loaded, so it may be inconvenient..
A new toolbar button should appear in the mail tabs.
Right click on message list header should reveal new column
that may be added to the folder view.

Download an archive with bURL from
<https://github.com/maxnikulin/burl/releases>
and extract the =burl_backend= executable,
let's assume that you created =~/.local/share/burl= folder for it.
Some details related to configuration may be found in
[[https://github.com/maxnikulin/burl][README file for bURL]]
and for the
[[https://github.com/maxnikulin/linkremark][LinkRemark browser extension]].

If you have installed bURL earlier for LinkRemark, update it to the latest
release.  As to configuration, it should be enough
to add =orco@maxnikulin.github.io= the =allowed_extensions= array
in the native application manifest.  The latter is located in
=~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts=.  If you use =news:= or =nntp:= links
in your notes then open the wrapper script specified in the =path= field
of the manifest and add e.g. =-scheme news= option to =burl_backend= command line.

For new users or if you prefer to have separate configuration for LinkRemark
and for orco it is necessary to create a new native messaging application manifest
and a wrapper for =burl_backend= that serves as its configuration file.
You need to provide paths to =burl_backend= and the wrapper,
to specify files for link lookup, to choose a name for native messaging helper
("burl" in the example below). Optionally add options like =-scheme news=
(=mid:= and =https:= links are extracted by default)
#+begin_example
  mkdir -p ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts
  ~/.local/share/burl/burl_backend -manifest-firefox ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/ \
      -mozilla-extension orco@maxnikulin.github.io \
      -backend burl \
      -wrapper ~/.local/share/burl/burl_wrapper \
      -org ~/org/notes.org \
      -org ~/org/capture.org
#+end_example
It should create =~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/burl.json= and
=~/.local/share/burl/burl_wrapper= files.  You may edit them to adjust
configuration.

Open Thunderbird add-on settings for orco and specify "burl" (or the name
you have chosen on the previous step) as native messaging helper.
If you have messages linked to emacs-orgmode mail list archive at
<https://list.orgmode.org/> than you may add this URL to the list
of prefixes.

Click on the add-on toolbar button (browser action) and do "refresh" in the popup.
The add-on fetches Message-IDs during Thunderbird startup.
There is no option to watch files for changes or setup periodic refresh yet.

To open particular locations in the files where the message is mentioned
Emacs server should be running: [[elisp:(server-start)][M-x server-start]]
For background see
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][Server]]
([[info:emacs#Emacs Server][info "(emacs) Emacs Server"]]).

Link may be hidden inside a folded heading.
To open it you may try the following hook:
#+begin_src elisp
  (defun burl-org-reveal-folded-line ()
    (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
      (org-reveal)))

  (add-hook 'server-visit-hook #'burl-org-reveal-folded-line)
#+end_src
Alternatively use =C-c C-r= that is a binding for =M-x= [[help:org-reveal][org-reveal]].

* Permissions

For details see
[[https://support.mozilla.org/kb/permission-request-messages-thunderbird-extensions][Permission request messages for Thunderbird extensions]]

#+begin_quote
Have full, unrestricted access to Thunderbird, and your computer
#+end_quote

WebExtensions API for add-ons does not provide a way to add custom columns,
so low level access using
[[https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/mailextensions/experiments][experiment APIs]]
is required to implement the feature.
The message sounds dangerous for purpose, so you need to audit the code
and to decided if you trust the developers.
Actually this extension monitors for tabs and windows with message list,
adds column and response to requests what should be displayed for particular
messages and threads by querying content of the Message-ID header.

Other permissions are hidden behind the most important one.

Exchange messages with other programs (=nativeMessaging=)

It is actual way to make requests related to file content or
to open particular location in Emacs.  Explicit configuration
is required to allow native messaging helper, but it is
essential as well.

"messagesRead" to obtain list of selected or displayed messages in response to
browser action click. Otherwise use context menu item to check mentions.

* Troubleshooting

The copy button on the log page of the popup puts to clipboard more details
than it is shown in the popup.

Check Thunderbirbird console =Ctrl+Shift+J= for errors, open add-on debugging tab
and click on "Inspect" link to get access to developers tools for the extension
and switch to console to see if some problem is reported there.
