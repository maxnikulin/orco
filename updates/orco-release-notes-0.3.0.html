    <h1>orco-0.3.0</h1>
    <h2>New Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Context menu entry for message body to check if you have a link
        in your notes.</li>
      <li>A shortcut may be configured in add-on manager.
        Unfortunately it is not the same as context menu item,
        so <code>[Shift+F10]</code> and accelerator key
        (currently <code>n</code>, but I am going to change it
        to <code>q</code> to have less alternative options)
        may be more convenient.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add message display action to messages open in new window
        since such views lack browser action toolbar button.</li>
      <li>Time when Message-IDs were fetched from files may be checked
        in the action popup to figure out if refresh is necessary.
        Earlier query for selected messages overwrote the log entry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The add-on requires native messaging helper application
